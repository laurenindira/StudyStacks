NOTES, COMMENTS, AND FEEDBACK
-----------------------------

Nice work here, too.  You've added plenty of detail past the prelimineary
version and I like your rationale for continuing to use Scrum for the product
development tracking.  The detail you have added to the key features and the
requirements are good, and the 'will' statements are a nice touch to help
explain the epics.  Putting the user story and acceptance criteria into a
table is a great way to show this part of the requirements.  Your diagrams
and explanatory text provide plenty of detail so that anyone can see what
needs to be done for creating any part of the project.  Your schedule has the
right level of detail for each sprint as well.

I'm curious about your burnup chart.  You show a total of 125 story points for
the project, but your chart shows you reaching that at the end of sprint 5.
In addition, the flat line for the first three sprints shows you are starting
the project with a total of about 80 story points but then at the end of sprint
three you are adding story points to reach your 125 maximum.  Shouldn't story
points constantly increase as you work your way through the project so that the
project total line reflects the actual count?  Also, your ideal line should run
from zero to the maximum as a straight line, which is the ideal to shoot for as
the project moves forward.

Another nice job from this team!  You have really taken the Agile Philosophy
and the software engineering concepts to heart and have done excellent work!

      5 of 5 points = 100.00% of 10 points which is an A-plus

Great continuation of your work!
