# Sprint Notes

## Sprint 0 (aka pre-planning)
Decided on the following things:
- Project Management System → Trello
- Product Backlog → wrote out everything we wanted to achieve for the product
- Roles (loosely) → Scrum Master (Brady), Product Owner (Lauren)
- Sprint Stand-Ups → Wednesdays at 8:30pm (or earlier, class time allowing)
- Story Points → 1 Point == 30 minutes
- Ticket Format for Trello → example below <img src="img/ticket_format_example.png" alt ="example ticket from Trello" height="300">
- Created columns for Trello boards → Product Backlog all on one board, and then in the Current Board, all of the To-Dos, In Progress, QA, and Finished tickets

## Sprint 1 
### Planning [2/5]
- **Sprint Goal**: Design all MVP pages in Figma + set up Auth in Xcode
- Sprint Duration → Feb 5 to Feb 19
- Sprint Backlog → All Figma Designs, set up Xcode project, Authentication
- Plan for completion → Figma (divided), Auth (Lauren) [specifics found in Trello]

### Stand-up [2/12]
- No significant blockers
- Brady → doing background research
- Giselle → still working
- Lauren → finished with Auth
- Raihana → finished with Figma

### Review + Retrospective [2/19]
**Review**
- All Figma designs finalized (with the exception of Dashboard, new ticket made for that)
- Ruleset made for GitHub → anything that is to be merged to main requires a PR to be submitted and reviewed by at least one other person

**Retrospective**
- Going forward, need to include more details on Trello
- Actually use QA column instead of sticking things directly into done → we move things into done after the Sprint retrospective? will test next spring

## Sprint 2
### Planning [2/19]
- **Sprint Goal**: Implement profile page, deck creation, and onboarding in Xcode + some minor Figma changes
- Sprint Duration → Feb 19 to March 5
- Sprint Backlog → Figma fixes, Xcode profile, deck, and onboarding base implementations
- Plan for completion [specifics found in Trello]
    - Brady → profile page implementation, fix Dashboard in Figma
    - Giselle → flashcard deletion + deck deletion + deck overview implementation
    - Lauren → deck creation + onboarding implementation, stack overview in Figma
    - Raihana → flashcard components + deck editing in Xcode

### Stand-up [2/26]
- General: addition to tickets → need a way to view decks to test creation
- Brady → no progress
- Giselle → no progress
- Lauren → finished stack overview in Figma, other minor UI changes
- Raihana → no progress

### Review + Retrospective [3/5]
