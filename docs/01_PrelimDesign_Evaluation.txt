NOTES, COMMENTS, AND FEEDBACK
-----------------------------

You all did very good work on this document!  You've fulfilled the requirements
for the preliminary document nicely.  I like the idea, it's a very good thing
which can definitely help students and others to learn new topics!  You have
put a lot of thought into the project and at the prelinimary design level, at
an architectural 'view', you have plenty of detail.  Your CSCI components are
well-planned and the scope of the project seems right for a small team and one
semester's time.  I like the diagram which shows the information flow of the
system quite well.  Your "straw man" schedule looks realistic, too, at this
point.

All in all a very nice job and a good start to the project!

Excellent start!
