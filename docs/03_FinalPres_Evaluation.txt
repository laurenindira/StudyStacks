Great work on this entire project!  It has been my great pleasure having you
four in class and I look forward to seeing you in the future as well!

presentation notes:
Flashcard application for mobile!
   found 'quizlet' was 'yuck'
   trying for unique, convenient
   allowing discovery, motivation, retention
Account based
   onboarding!  what do you want/need
   library of cards
   social element with leader board
   3 collections
   profile
used Trello and google docs
used Scrum, found it easy and flexible
found Trello to be easy, but it's really for Kanban so some inconvenience
thought about having badges, but didn't get implemented yet
Challenges ~ misunderstanding each other
             waiting until meeting for questions
             group texting required patience
Lesson learned ~ ask for help early

Questions:
   flutter considered? yes, but not enough experience
   keep working on it? maybe
   burndown recovery question

these four just rocked it!  Excellent presentation, very good idea, well done
implementation, nice UI, snappy response


Nice job!
