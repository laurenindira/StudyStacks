## Main Features
- **Flashcard Stacks** --> Create, study, and browse stacks across multiple subjects from your Dashboard or the built-in Library of public stacks
- **Studying and Remembering** --> Flip over cards to test your knowledge, swipe right if you got it, or left if you need some work
- **Friend System** --> Add friends who also use the app so you can share stacks, see each other's profiles, and compare points on the Leaderboard to see who can study the most cards in any week
- **User Profile** --> Keep track of and update all your saved stacks, created stacks, and personal information in the profile and settings pages
- **Study Reminders + Streaks** --> Set a daily reminder so that we can keep you on target. Keep coming back so that your streak stacks up
